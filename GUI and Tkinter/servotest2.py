####MR. MURRAY'S CODE STARTS HERE####
"""
The code to run a servo is just this one line:
"""

#pwm.set_pwm(0, 0, 300)

"""
WHAT THIS MEANS:
pwm.set_pwm([channel number goes here], 0, [servo direction number goes here])
eg.
The servo function has three parameters seperated by commas.
(0,0,0)
Change the first 0 to select what servo you want to use.
eg. (1,0.0) selects servo plugged into in channel 1 on the servo board.
I have no idea what the second parameter is or does.
Change the third parameter to any value from 150 to 600 to control servos's direction.
eg.
pwm.set_pwm(0, 0, 300) sets servo plugged into channel 0 to about half way.
pwm.set_pwm(2, 0, 150) sets servo plugged into channel 2 to all the way left.
pwm.set_pwm(1, 0, 600) sets servo plugged into channel 1 to all the way right.

#YOUR CODE STARTS HERE
